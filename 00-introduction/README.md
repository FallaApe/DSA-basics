# Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

## What is DSA?

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** is the study of:

* how data is stored in memory
* how data is processed to solve problems efficiently

In short:

* **Data Structure** → how data is organized
* **Algorithm** → steps to work on that data

Both are required together to write good programs.

## Why do we study DSA?

In real programs, data size can grow large.
If logic is inefficient:

* programs become slow
* memory usage increases

DSA helps us:

* write efficient code
* handle large input sizes
* improve logical thinking
* solve problems in a structured way

## Normal Programming vs DSA Approach

### Normal Programming

* Uses simple variables or lists
* Works fine for small input
* Performance is usually not considered

Example:

```python
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```

### DSA-Based Approach

In DSA, we choose data structures based on the problem.

Examples:

* Arrays → fast access
* Linked Lists → dynamic size
* Stack → last in, first out
* Queue → first in, first out
* Hashing → fast lookup
* Trees → hierarchical data

The goal is to **reduce time and memory usage**.

## What are Algorithms?

An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem.

Example:

* searching for an element
* sorting numbers
* reversing a list

Different algorithms solve the same problem differently.
Some are faster, some are simpler.

## How this Repository is Organized

* Each folder represents one DSA topic
* Each file represents one problem
* Code is written for clarity and learning
* Focus is on implementation, not theory

Topics are arranged in learning order:

* Arrays
* Sorting
* Searching
* Recursion
* Linked Lists
* Stack and Queue
* Hashing
* Trees

## Goal of this Repository

* Build strong DSA fundamentals
* Make revision easy
* Keep explanations simple and clear

This repository is intended for beginners and students learning DSA step by step.
